# Hospitality GraphQL

## How to run it locally

Make sure that you have a recent version of node, node >= 10 will do. To check your current node version, execute `node -v` in your terminal. If node would not be installed, I advice you to install `nvm`. This is a `Node Version Manager` that lets you easily update your node version. For more information see https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

Make sure that you have installed all dependencies `npm install`.

Afterwards just run `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000/graphql` to open the playground.

The server will now watch any changes and update when needed.

## Exercises

All the exercises are located in the `./exercises` directory. All exercises are build in such a way that the solution of exercise n is needed to start exercise n + 1.

Don't worry, if you get stuck you can check out the `exercise/xxx` branch which contains the solution for that particular exercise.
